# Forest Cover Type 
The idea of this notebook is using the forest cover type dataset to find the predominant kind of tree cover using Deep learning.
Here we have used the deep learning with two different features set using two different methods:
## 1- Extra Tree Classifier method (Feature selection) 
This method slect the best features set based on theire importance.
## 2- Feature engineering (Feature dxtraction)
Create new features using the combination between the real variables.

# Model
After that we applied Deep learning using Keras using just the features selected.
